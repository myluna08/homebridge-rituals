Homebridge Rituals is a homebridge-plugin to manage a Rituals Genie over homebridge infrastructure.
Homebridge is a lightweight NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API.

Since Siri supports devices added through HomeKit, this means that with Homebridge you can ask Siri to control devices that don't have any support for HomeKit at all. For instance, using just some of the available plugins, you can say:

With this plugin you can do

- _Siri, turn on the Genie._
- _Siri, turn off the Genie._

#### Before begin, (assumptions)

- Your genie has been registered using Official Rituals App.
- Your genie is working fine. (obviously)
- Your <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">homebridge</a> is working fine and has been added to your home app as bridge. If not, please take a look to <a href="#considerations">Installation from zero</a>.

```

MULTIPLE GENIES IN YOUR account
If you have more than one genie in your account, use the standard config for the first time and see the LOG. The Genie identifiers should appear in the log. Then add the "hub" key in the config to indicate what genie you want to control.

1. Declare standard mode

```json
    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "Rituals",
            "name": "Genie",
            "account": "xxx@xxx.com",
            "password": "yyyyyyy",
            "model_version": "v.0"
        }
    ],
```

2. Wait for the LOG , like this..

```

        "account": "xxx@xxx.com",
        "password": "yyyyyyy",
        "hub": "f0123456789f0123456789f0123456789f0123456789f0123456789f01234567"
    },
    {
        "accessory": "Rituals",
        "name": "Genie 02",
        "account": "xxx@xxx.com",
        "password": "yyyyyyy",
        "hub": "a0123456789a0123456789a0123456789a0123456789a0123456789a01234567"
    }

- You can control start/stop.
- Fan control is not available in this release (see changelog).

- [ ] Allow to show the fragance quantity remains inside genie ¿?
